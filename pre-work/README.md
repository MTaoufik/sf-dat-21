Congratulations on joining us at General Assembly for the Data Science course!

In order to help ensure your success in the course, we’ve made a pre-course checklist.  **Complete all the items on the list** and when you arrive on your first day, you and your computer will be prepared for the first lesson.  The more time spent familiarizing yourself with the tools in the pre-course tutorials (git, command line, python, etc), the better prepared you will be for success in this course.

We are so excited we are to have you join the General Assembly community!

## Accounts and Installations

**COMPLETE BY THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS**

1. [ ] [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one
2. [ ] Install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - **Note**: We will be using Python 2.7 in this course, NOT Python 3, which is significant different from 2.7
3. [ ] Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
  - Test for successful installation. For example, on a Mac you can by open a Terminal window (using the Anaconda Launcher app, if needed) and type `ipython notebook`.  In a few moments, your browser should open to a window titled "Jupyter"
4. [ ] Install [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/), the recommended package manager for Python
  - **Note**: Most versions of Python come with `pip` pre-installed.  Check by opening your Terminal and running `pip install -U pip` to see if you have the latest version

If your installation is not complete or if you have any problems, plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to the first class so that our TAs can help you get set up!

## Pre-course Tutorials

**COMPLETE BY THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS**

Review the following resources as an introduction to some commonly used concepts and tools.

1. [ ] Review our [Command Line](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) tutorial to familiarize yourself with basic Terminal commands.  Pay particular attention to folder navigation and file creation
  - _Bonus Option: Run through these additional exercises from [Learn Command Line the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)_
2. [ ] Complete [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) through Lesson 35
3. [ ] Complete [Learn Pandas](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas) through Lesson 3
4. [ ] Complete the following three "missions" from [Dataquest.io](http://dataquest.io/):
  - Introduction
  - Find the US city with the lowest crime rate
  - Analyze NFL data
5. [ ] Refresh your familiarity with [Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) by reviewing sample materials from this Khan Academy course
  - _Bonus Option: Read through this [10 minute guide to Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) to learn about a popular library we'll be using for data analysis_

## Pre-course Python Self-Assesment

**COMPLETE BY THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS**

### Questions

1. How do you create an empty list named "mylist"?
2. What will the following code return?  `5 > 3 or 5 < 3`
3. What will be stored in the "nums" object?  `nums = range(10)`
4. How do you check the type and the length of the "nums" object?
5. How do you return the last number in the "nums" object?
6. Slice the "nums" object to return a list with the numbers 2, 3, 4
7. What is the difference between `nums.append(10)` and `nums + [10]`?
8. How do you divide 3 by 2 and get a result of 1.5?
9. Import the "math" module, and then use its "sqrt" function to calculate the square root of 1089
10. What type of object is created by this code?  `d = {'a':10, 'b':20, 'c':30}`
11. In the "d" object, what are "a", "b", and "c" called?  What are 10, 20, and 30 called?
12. How do you return the 10 from the "d" object?
13. How do you change the 30 to a 40 in the "d" object?
14. From the "people" object, return Brandon's state only: `people = {'Alice': ['Washington', 'DC'], 'Brandon': ['Arlington', 'VA']}`
15. Define a function "calc" that takes two variables, "a" and "b", and returns their sum

## Additional Resources (Optional)

Below are links to some resources that may supplement your Python learning experience.  They are **NOT** required and there is no single "best" resource; instead, you should try out a few and then focus on the one that teaches Python in a way that you understand.
